<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>In ACF, each option contract represents a command 
line syntax for console application, so create and define the option contracts 
is the most important and common&nbsp;task while using ACF to build your 
applications. In this chapter, we are going to define two different contracts 
for <FONT face=Courier color=#800000>catool</FONT>, the first is to display the 
version information, and the other is to perform the arithmetic operations on 
the given integers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=2>Currently you just need to follow the steps that we 
have demonstrated. Don't ask why, the answers to the questions that confused 
you&nbsp;can be found under the <STRONG>Design of the Adaptive Console 
Framework</STRONG> node of this developer's manual.</FONT></P></BODY>
